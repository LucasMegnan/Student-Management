# Student Data Management System

## Overview
This is a simple Student Data Management System implemented in C++ that allows you to store, update, retrieve, and remove student records. The program also supports sorting students based on their enrollment year using the Merge Sort algorithm, and searches students by ID using a custom Binary Search Tree (BST) implementation.

## Features
- **Add Student**: Allows you to add a student with details like ID, name, surname, age, enrollment years, and warnings.
- **View Student**: Retrieve and display student details by their ID.
- **Update Student**: Update the name, surname, and age of a student.
- **Sort Students**: Sort students based on their enrollment year using Merge Sort.
- **Search Student**: Use Binary Search to find a student by their ID.
- **Remove Student**: Placeholder functionality for removing a student (requires additional implementation).

## Data Structures Used
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: The students are stored in a Binary Search Tree where each node contains a student. The BST allows efficient insertion, search, and future deletion operations.
- **Vector**: Used to store lists of enrollment years and warnings for each student.
- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm to sort students by their first enrollment year.

## Getting Started
To compile and run this project, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC or Visual Studio).

### Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-data-management.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd student-data-management
   ```

3. **Compile the program**:
   For Linux or macOS:
   ```bash
   g++ -o student_management main.cpp
   ```

   For Windows (using Visual Studio, for example):
   - Open the project in your Visual Studio IDE and build the solution.

4. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
   ./student_management
   ```

5. **Follow the on-screen menu** to add, view, update, or remove student records.

## Usage
When you run the program, you will be presented with a menu that allows you to:

1. **Add Student**: Enter a student's details, including ID, name, age, enrollment years, and warnings.
2. **View Student**: Retrieve a student's information by entering their ID.
3. **Update Student**: Modify a student's name, surname, and age.
4. **Remove Student**: (Placeholder) The current version does not implement full removal functionality.
5. **Sort Students by Enrollment Year**: Sort all students based on the first year they enrolled.
6. **Exit**: Exit the program.

## Limitations
- **Remove Student**: The functionality for removing a student is not yet fully implemented. Deleting nodes in a Binary Search Tree requires handling multiple cases (e.g., node with two children).
- **Warnings Handling**: While warnings are added, further features such as removing or editing individual warnings can be added in future versions.

## Example
Here is an example of adding a student:

```
Enter student ID: 123
Enter student's first name: John
Enter student's surname: Doe
Enter student's age: 21
Enter the number of enrollment years: 2
Enter enrollment year 1: 2020
Enter enrollment year 2: 2021
Enter the number of warnings: 1
Enter warning reason: Late submission
```

Once the student is added, you can view, update, or sort the students by their enrollment year.

## Future Enhancements
- **Implement complete student removal functionality in the Binary Search Tree**.
- **Add more sophisticated warning management, such as removal or modification**.
- **Improve user interface with better error handling and input validation**.
